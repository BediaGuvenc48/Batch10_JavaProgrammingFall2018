		/*
		 * Important things about using variables in java 
		 * when we use variables then we have to pay attention to the follwoing points: 
		 * 1. Type/datatype 2. name 3. Value 
		 * Java is a strongly typed language 
		 * it means before using any variable, we need to declare first 
		 * when you declare, we need to put type and name, 
		 * for Example: int steps; //it means a variable called steps that can hold integers. 
		 * each variable will be declared once, the system will not allow you. 
		 * double steps;// will not allowed, because already declared as integer 
		 * Variable names - sometimes can be called as Identifiers 
		 * 
		 * double price; 
		 * System.out.println("price"); // it will not be printed, you must assign a value to it. 
		 * 
		 * initialize -> means assigning a value for the first time. 
		 * 
		 * how do we initialize? we just put a price like; double price = 10.0; 
		 * 
		 * Variable naming rules: 
		 * 1): The variable can be any length. maybe thousands of characters or words. 
		 * Example: String absklgjlkdsjfglkdsfjglkdsfjglskdjfg; 
		 * 
		 * 2): Variables can contain letters, -, $, numbers 
		 * Example: int today_is_review_$session = 1; 
		 * 
		 * 3): Variables can not start with numbers, but can contain numbers in the middle or end. 
		 * Example: int 1stDay// it is not allowed and will not work 
		 * 
		 * 4): Variables can not accept keywords or reserved words like; public, double, class and etc. 
		 * 
		 * 5): Meaningful words are preferred, and start with lower-case, 
		 * 		and then the next word starts with upper case. We call the style camelCase.  
		 * 
		 * 6): The variables can be named with upper case even using the keywords, but it is not recommended.
