Java Programming Day 25:
-	The topics we covered in last sprint:
o	Why we need arrays and data structures
o	How to create arrays with size
o	How to initialize and declare in one statement
o	How to iterate through each item in an array
o	For Each loop:
	It works with arrays or other collections only

-	We can’t add another item to the array later on. Because it is a fixed size. We can not change its size either by increasing or decreasing. But we can modify change values within it.
-	KitchenItems[11] = “Table”;
Arrays are fixed size and it keeps ordering of values/elements.

-	In for each loop we only loop forward, not backward.
