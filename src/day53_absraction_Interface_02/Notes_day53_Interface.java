WarmUPTask: 
- Create an Abstract class Called Shape 
- It has a field called name : String 
- Create a constructor to set the name 

-> create an abstract method called calculate area 

-> Create 2 sub classes of Shape : Recangel and Circle  

	Rectangle: 
		- instance field ; 
			width, hieght : in 
	
		 no Args Constructor : Just print this is Rectangle 
		 3 arg constructor to set all 3 fields value 

Interface: 

-> Contract between a class and outside world 
-> Provide set of absract methods 
-> A class implements an interface 
-> The class provides the behaviours included in the interface 
-> Interface can also 

Task2:
- Create an interface called Drawable 
- with constant COLOR 
- and abstract method draw() return nothing 
- another abstract method drawLine, have one parameter direction : String 

- Let the rectangle class implements theis interface 
		 
-> Any method in interface by default is public visible (Most Access Modifier)

-> If you don't have 

-> if you add default, you can make a method like that 

public deafult void drawSquare(){
	System.out.println("I will wait for your implementation"); 
	
}

-> Interface can not be final, since you are doing some actions, if it is final then you can not do implementations 

Exending another Interface: 

	-> Sub interface can have same abstract methods as 
	
	-> If you want to have an instance variable in interface then it should final, if you don't put final, but defualt it is final
