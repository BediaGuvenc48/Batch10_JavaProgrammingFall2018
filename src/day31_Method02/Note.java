Methods:

What are methods?
-	Methods are behavior that cantinas repeatable code.
Reusable actions/statements.
-	Methods are behavior of classes/objects

Why do we need methods in Java programming? What is the benefit?
-	Readability
-	Reusability of code
-	Easy maintain the code
-	More organized code
-	More efficient programming because of the reusability
-	Easier to debug

What best practices of programming you follow?
-	I try to organize my code into reusable methods, make my code easy to read and maintain.

How to create methods in Java?
-	We create/define methods in the Class and it will be attached/related to that class.

Example:
	public static void myMethod() {

body of the method which doesn’t accept any argument.

String day = “Saturday”;
String myClass = “java methods”;
System.out.println(“Today is: “ + day + “, we are studying “ + class);

}

	public static void myMethod2(String day) {

String day = “Saturday”;
String class = “java methods”;
System.out.println(“Today is: “ + day + “, we are studying “ + class);

}

Agenda:

-	Method with return value
-	Method with return value and accepting parameter (s)

String name = “Bob”;
System.out.println(name);

Int [] nums = {23, 34, 64, 75};
Arrays.sort(nums);

The above examples are void method that do not return a value, it runs some statements, but doesn’t return a value.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The above String method examples, each of them run some statements and return a value at the end, indexOf return a number, charAt return char.


Method that return a value. Most of the times (80 % of time) a method return a value and 20 % of time it is only void method which doesn’t return a value.

Example:

	    (Return Type)

public static int giveme5$() {

int d = 5;
return 5;

}

public static String whatisYourName(){

String name = “Murodil”;
return name;
}

Public static int myMethod(String str){
return st.length();
}
