Programming is like recipe for cooking.
Computer Program is a step by step instruction.

In Programming we deal with data all the time. To categorize the data we divide them into
DATA TYPES:
1): primitives
2): Objects/Non-Primitives/Class type
String, Scanner (We have studied so far), there are more than 5000 codes like this written in Java ready to use in your computer.

String: A simple value in double quotes, computer treats it as a String Object, it is a combination of multiple characters (chars).

Substring:

Substring (6); -ïƒ  Starts from index 6 until the very end. Index always starts from (0);
