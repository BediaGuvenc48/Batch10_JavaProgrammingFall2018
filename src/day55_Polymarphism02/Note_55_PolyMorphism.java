-> The inheritance relatinoship will explain which object is bigger and it will lead you to do downcasting or upcasting. 

-> I you want to call dog, object, then it will not bark, if you call dog a dog, then it will bark. 

-> Always look for IS-A relationship and it will let you to access the object easily.

Casting: 

1. Upcasting: It is casting from a subclass to a superclass, typically the upcasting is implicitly performed by the compiler. 

2. Downcasting: Casting from a superclass type to subclass type is called downcasting. The upcasting has to be performed by
   the programmer explicitly.
