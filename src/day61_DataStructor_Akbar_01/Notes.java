/*
 
 
 Benefits: 
 
 
 
 Collection Framework: 
 
 	- Interface: 
 	- Implementations: It is basically those 
 	- Algorithm: It gives you different functionality and whatever is convinience for the programming. 
 	
 -> Whatever you see in orange is Iterable, then collection, 
 
 Iterable: Anything that you can iterate at all. It is a super class of collections and super interface of all collections. It 
 	-> Collection 
 1. List 
 2. Set 
 		-> SortedSet 
 3. Queue 
 		-> Deque 
 
 4. Map 
 5. SortedMap

Common Behavior: 

Collection: Provides based guidlines 
	List: 
	

-> Anything which is iterable, you can use for each loop to iterate through or you can use from iterate method to iterate. 
-> We can't use for loop, because we don't have an index to iterate through

List<E> subList = list.subList(1, 4); --> This will give you an specific index range of the original object. It is not a copy. 


Collections: It is a class, Has a lot of utility methods. 

TreeSet -> organize the sorting order from Asky Table.
