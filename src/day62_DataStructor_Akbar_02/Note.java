  Difference between TreeSet & HashSet: 
 
  TreeSet is slower than the HashSet, because TreeSet is working twice harder then the HashSet, 
  TreeSet is finds the unique and sorted in ascending order, but Hashset only finds the unique element 
  and does not care about the the order. 
  
  Collection Framework from 100000 mile above: 
  
  Iterface: 
  
  Map 
  	--> SortedMap 
  	
  It is has a key and a value, so it will return 2
