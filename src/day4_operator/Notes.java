    Programming Class:

	Starts from the beginning that majority of students don’t’ have experience.

Today’s Agenda:

-	What is a computer?
-	Hardwar vs Software
-	How computers work
-	Binary System
-	Computational thinking
-	Understand how programming works
-	Programming visual blocks
-	Identify universal programming concept
-	Algorithm
-	Problem Solving
-	Programming Concepts
-	Visual Programming

Process:
Input ----  Computer -- Output
Source of Input
Internet/Output

Computer definition: It takes input, process it and gives you output.
Source of output:
-	Internet/Cloud
-	Audio
-	Print
-	Drive
-	Display
-	Screen (can be also input if it is touch screen)

Mouse is an input unit, keyboard is an input unit, we put information, or we command to do something.

Servicers: more specialized computers with special software. It could be from internet or physically in front of you.

The computer language is Binary System (0,1) zero and one which is On and Off. Whatever information is used in computer it is changed to binary system to be able to read by the computer.

Decimal
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, the computer will not know even 9, until you process it in binary system. When it is processed it should be in 0 & 1 codes.

CPU (Central Processing Unit)

Transistors

When we say 0 there is no electricity going to transistors, if we say 1, then there is an information goes to the computer like a bulb which becomes on and off.

When you install a transistor, then the cooler (fan) should be outfacing.

The number of transistors every time the new computers come, the number of transistors are added.

The CPU Executes the program, in every computer there is a CPU, brain of the computer, and it will execute/process instructions/

How Binary System works?

When it is 0 0 0, it means it is off and there is no electricity going to it. If we have 3 transistors, if we have 3 containers and we have $4, $2, $1

-	001 means 1 to the computer (1-> is 001 in computer)
-	010 means 2 to the computer (2-> is 010 in computer)
001-> 1
010 ->2
101 ->5

10 -> 1 0 1 0 (it means that in each container we have containers)

15-> 1111 (8 4 2 1)

13-> 1101 (8 4 0 1) total is 13.

100->             	64 32 16 8 4 2 1   = 1100110

200->            	128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1 = 1 1 0 0 1 0 0

5000-> 	4096 2048 1024 512 256 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1 = 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0

Schedule:

-	Monday -> Group Projects (Tech/Non-tech)
-	Tuesday -> Technical Class
-	Wednesday -> Review + Practice + new items
-	Thursday -> Non – Tech
-	Saturday & Sunday -> Technical
-	Fridays will be announced as required

0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 = 55

1 Bit can store one on or off.
1 Bye = 8 Bit
1 Kbyte = 1024 Bytes
1 Megabyte = 1024 Kilobytes
1 Giga Byte (GB) =1024 Megabytes

ASCII SYSTEM:

A	B 	C	D	E	F	G	H	I ………
65	66	67	68	69	70	71	72	73…….

ASCII SYSTEM: is a universal international system that understand all computers. Each character has will have a corresponding number to represent.

Example:
H	I	!
72 	73	33
If you use Java then you will learn how to use the ASCII System.

HDD of Computer:

-	Mother Board or Mainboard or System board:
-	CPU Registers
-	CMPU -> L memories
-	Cache (closest and smallest memory to the CPU).
-	Level 1 (L1)
-	Level 2
-	Level 3

-	RAM (Random Access Memory): it is temporary memory and once you turn off the computer, then all information will be gone.

o	Physical RAM: Temporary Memory, the more RAM is, the faster the computer works.
o	Virtual Memory

-	Whatever we open the loads through the RAM, if your RAM is bigger in size the more programs you can open.

-	Secondary Storage Devices Type

-	ROM (Read Only Memory)/BIOS

-	HDD (Hard Disk Drive),

-	SSD (Solid State Drive) is much faster than HDD

Input Devices:
-	Scanner
-	Microphone
-	Graphics tablet
-	Keyboard
-	Webcam
-	Barcode reader
-	Digial camera

Output Devices:
-	Printer
-	Plotter
-	Monitor
-	Speaker
-	Projector

Input/Output Devices:
-	Pen Drive
-	Touch Screen
-	CD/DVD

Using Key Notes:’

User
Application
Operating System
Hardware

Sometimes different application works with certain operating system.

Different Operating System:
-	IOS
-	Apple
-	Windows

First computers usually used DOS (Direct Operating System) then Norton Commander came and then Mac OS System 1.0 (released in 1984) System 1.0 was the first operating system GUI.

ALGORITHM:

-	Step by step instructions for solving a problem. The process of solving a problem step by step is Algorithm.
-	Algorithm for phone books search
-	Input - Algorithm -Output

Computational Thinking:

-	Input - Algorithm -Output (it is always like that), the artificial intelligence like self-driving cars are Algorithms, somebody put all those step by step instructions.

If you have a phonebook with first name and last name and phone numbers:

0.	Pick up phone book (the orange colors are commands or actions)
1.	Open to the middle of the book
2.	Look at the names
3.	If “Smith” is among the names (the orange color is a condition, in computer you can’t put conditions).
4.	Call Mike Smith
5.	Else if “Smith” is earlier in book, then open the first half of the book (split it again), look at the names again.
6.	Else if “Smith” is later in book,
7.	Go to line 2
8.	Else
9.	Quit

Pseudo-Code -> is written in any human language (English, Russian, Turkish etc) to describe your Algorithm.

Normally programmers write Pseudocode then

Example:
Send an email to a friend:
0.	Check if computer is on
1.	Then go to line 2
2.	Turn on the computer
3.	Open the browser
4.	Login to email account
5.	Click on Compose
6.	Write email address, subject, email body
7.	Click on send

*** There are different programming languages ****

-	Low Level Languages (Assembly language, used primarily for direct hardware manipulation.
o	Machine language: Machine
o	Assembly languages programming

-	Middle-Languages:
o	Used by system and hardware programmers and for performance critical software: C, C++
-	High-Level Language:
o	Java, C-Sharp and etc.

Before these languages existed, the programmers used binary system.

-	Each programming language is created for a specific purpose, Java is one of the popular ones.

The entire purpose of programming languages is to avoid writing machine code (binary language).
Programmers write source code   -Compile or Interpreter - CPU understands machine code

Sometimes we have compilers languages
Interpreted languages JavaScript, Python, PHP

Hybrid languages:
-	Java
-	ActionScript
-	LISP

Examples:
-	Source Code: is the actual code that the programmer writes it.

COBOL : is one of the old languages, it is upper case writings

Python: is in lower case

PHP: you can use some symbols

Visual Basic: it is a combination of COBOL, Python & PHP which includes upper case, lower case and symbols.

C#: used for Microsoft

When you write a program, you have to have all requirement like a cooking list (Recipe X):
What ingredients?
What quantities?
-	Step 1
-	Step 2
-	Step 4
-	Step
When you write a program, the order is very important.

Order of computer instruction is very important:
Directions like; Recipe
Normally codes are written top to button and left to write

Programmers Text Editors
Notepad++
Sublime Text
Brackets
Atom
jEdit
Viim
Emacs
TextWrangler
UltraEdit
BBEdit
Coda
EditPad
BlueFish
KomodoEdit



IDE: Integrated Development Environment

Most Programmers use Monospaced Font, it is taking less space
-	Examples

Proportional Fonts: Not a good idea to sue them, because there are spaces that are not required.

Basic Programming Concepts:
-	Once you are master in this, then you can understand other languages and it is easier which takes a couple of days to learn.
o	Storing Data:
o	Manipulating Data
o	Sequence
o	Conditional Branching
o	Repetition
-	Every Complex program is only a combination of these.

Types of data:
-	Geographical
-	Cultural
-	Scientifics
-	Transportation
-	Financial

Type: 		Example:
Numeric	1234.


Data Containers:
Variable
3 important information about Variables:
1.	Name:
2.	Value
3.	Type

Once you use the data, you can use it later or edit it, add more information.

Declaring a Variable:
Exmaple:

Swift
Var score: Int (integer)

Visual Basic:
Dim score as Integer

C++
int score;

Java:
int score;

The characters called string in Java language.

Manipulating means adding, subtracting and compiling with other DATAs.

Variable by itself is just a storage of DATA, it is not the DATA, because we can change it and process it.

Sequence Structure:
-	Instruction 1;
-	Instruction 2;
-	Instruction;
-	………

Statement Execute in Order
-	In Java when we end a statement, we put ; instead of .
-	Statement one
-	Statement two
-	Statement three might

Conditional Branching: is common in every programming language.
If (conditional is true) THEN
do this;
ELSE
  		 do this;
Boolean:
True  	   or 	False

The true and false answers called Boolean.

Example:

If (balance > 1000) {
System.out.print1n(“You have more than 1000 this account.”)

Mulitple Branches
If supermarket full-fat milk
If it’s on sale AND expiration date > 2 weeks ahead
	Buy two full fat milk
Else
	Buy one full fat milk
End
Else
	If have 2% milk
	Buy 2% milk
	Else
	Buy skimmed milk
	End
End

You have to make sure that both conditionals are checked, because it has a AND word.

Repetition /Looping:
Looping allows you to execute one or more lines of code as many times as you need to.

Example: instead of writing Happy New year to 100 contacts you can write a programing language like below:

For each friend in contacts
Friend.send_message(“Happy New Year!”)
End

Example:
“repeat this 100000 times”
{
Statement one
Statement two
Statement three
//etc.
}

“repeat this for each employee in the company”
{
Statement one
Statement two
Statement three
//etc.
